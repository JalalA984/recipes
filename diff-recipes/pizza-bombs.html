    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsburyâ„¢ Grands!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pepperoni, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pop open the biscuit can and divide into 8 biscuits. Flatten each biscuit with your thumb into a 1/8-inch thick circle.</li>
        <li>Spread the center of each circle with about 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, leaving a 1/4-inch edge open. Sprinkle each circle with about 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, and about 1 tablespoon pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Pull up the edges of each circle to form a ball, and seal completely. Roll them in your hands to ensure the dough is sealed, then set each ball on the baking sheet seal-side-down.</li>
        <li>Brush each ball with melted butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve with additional warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
